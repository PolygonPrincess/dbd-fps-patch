# Dead by Daylight FPS Patch

Currently, this script only supports Windows. I'd like to support Linux as well eventually so might try getting the game to run on Linux and testing it. Steam and Epic versions have been tested, still need to test the Windows Store/Game Pass version.

To run, simply download the `dbd-120-fps.ps1` (you can use this [link](https://github.com/PolygonPrincess/dbd-fps-patch/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the entire repository as a zip file), right click the file, and select "Run with PowerShell". This has been tested on Windows 11, so Windows 10, 8, and 7 may slightly differ.

**NOTE**: This will not guarantee the game will run at 120 fps, it simply unlocks the game to run UP TO that frame rate. The game is capped at 120 frames per second, so that is the maximum achievable frame rate.

If there any bugs, feel free to report them, or if you'd like to contribute feel free to!!
