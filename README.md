# Dead by Daylight FPS Patch

Currently, this script only supports Windows. I'd like to support Linux as well eventually so might try getting the game to run on Linux and testing it. Steam and Epic versions have been tested, still need to test the Windows Store/Game Pass version.

To run, simply download the `dbd-120-fps.ps1`, right click the file, and select "Run with PowerShell". This has been tested on Windows 11, so Windows 10, 8, and 7 may slightly differ.

If there any bugs, feel free to report them, or if you'd like to contribute feel free to!!
